# Contributor guide

All contributions are appreciated!

Feature requests and bug reports can be raised as Issues.

Code changes can be made as a Pull Request to the `main` branch.
A review will be required before the changes can be merged.

## Review guidelines

When reviewing code, consider:

- Are the changes clearly and accurately described,
  either in the pull request or an associated issue?

- Does the code remain compatible with all [black] style rules?

- Are the modified areas of code understandable?
  The code itself should be clear and easy to read,
  supplemented by comments as needed.

- Have doctrings been added to new code,
  and/or are relevant existing docstrings still correct?

- Is there an appropriate level of test coverage?
  This does not mean every implementation detail, only main components.
